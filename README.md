I am designing a database of employees who worked for the corporation Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s.

I used a diagraming tool to design the tables for the database
 
After creating the tables and importing the data I performed the following data anlaysis tasks: 
- reviewing all of the employees in the database and their salaries
- determining the employees that were hired in a given year (1986)
- listing the managers for each department
- understanding which department each employee is assigned to
- listing the gender of all employees with a specified name
- determining the employees that work in Sales as well as those that work in either Sales or Development
- and finally reviewing how many employees share last names
